Transportation wizard for CMC. The project is to update the UI of the edu2mfg.org to be more dynamic (career exploration, job searching, tour notifications, match making, etc.). The clientâ€™s main priority is to have functional tools created for their internal team to aid in their ability to connect users with resources and employers with users who have used the platform. The clients secondary requests are to update the UI of their website and to create a functional app that uses this information.
