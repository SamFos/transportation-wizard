California Mobility Center is working with Siemen's Mobility, for employer funded transportation service. Base on SMUD heatmeat(https://usage.smud.org/SustainableCommunities/), CMC is looking at the areas with lower income that may have higher desire or demands for utilizing custom transportation service.

Looking at this area of the map above and using Paratransit(at least 20 people max) for custom transportation. In this example, we have approximately 40 employees in this area and out of 40, 16 people express interest for pickup. CMC want to identify optimal waypoints, and each destination may have a stop at 1, 2, or 3 location etc, with at least 1 mile radius for the next location. Everyone will be going to the same location after pickup which is Siemens Mobility pr vice versa, leaving Siemens Mobility.







Transportation wizard for CMC. The project is to update the UI of the edu2mfg.org to be more dynamic (career exploration, job searching, tour notifications, match making, etc.). The clientâ€™s main priority is to have functional tools created for their internal team to aid in their ability to connect users with resources and employers with users who have used the platform. The clients secondary requests are to update the UI of their website and to create a functional app that uses this information.
