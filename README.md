California Mobility Center is working with Siemen's Mobility, for employer funded transportation service. Base on SMUD heatmeat(https://usage.smud.org/SustainableCommunities/), CMC is looking at the areas with lower income that may have higher desire or demands for utilizing custom transportation service.

Why custom transportation? Siemens Mobility work shift starts at 5:30 AM and most of the public busses do not start running until 7 AM

CMC is going to narrow focus on a certain area and is going to reach out to individuals to see who is interested to participate
in this program. Then would try to come up with optimal travel plans and routes and to see if this custom route is feasible.

Looking at this area of the map above and using Paratransit(at least 20 people max) for custom transportation. In this example, we have approximately 40 employees in this area and out of 40, 16 people express interest for pickup. CMC want to identify optimal waypoints, and each destination may have a stop at 1, 2, or 3 location etc, with at least 1 mile radius for the next pickup location. Another thing to note, pickup locations will not be at employee location to maintain their privacy. Everyone will be going to the same location after pickup which is Siemens Mobility pr vice versa, leaving Siemens Mobility.

CMC would also like to incorporate and integrate in a single map of public transport route, tags to show what bus route it is and stops.
